            While most think Option A is true and don’t consider option B, let
            it be clear that Nutrition includes BOTH of these. If everyone
            begins to recognize that what is eaten matters as much as how it
            affects the body, everyone will live healthier lives.

            All of these nutrients have a definite role and are obtained from
            different food sources. The health of the individual is influenced
            by the utilization of nutrients is called the nutritional status of
            an individual. The nutritional status can be determined through
            medical checkups, by the process of collecting and interpreting
            dietary and medical history. The nutritional status of a person can
            be good, fair, or poor.{"\n"}
            {"\n"} Nutritional assessment aids in identifying under-nutrition,
            overnutrition (more on this in a while), nutritional deficiencies,
            individuals at the risk of developing malnutrition, individuals at
            the risk of developing nutritionally related diseases, the resources
            available to assist them to overcome nutritional problems. Curiosity
            about nutrition is not a new phenomenon. Scientists have been
            studying food and nutrition for centuries. However, the landscape of
            Modern Nutrition has developed in recent years. During the initial
            years of the 20th Century, the discovery, isolation, and synthesis
            of micronutrients were performed. The goal was to study diseases of
            deficiency. With this, the advent of nutrition science began to take
            shape. It is not shocking to learn that widespread diseases were a
            starting point of most nutrition-centered research. More research
            was conducted about non-communicable diseases and how nutrition
            plays a role in them. Over the years, nutrition scientists realized
            that it is not nutrients in isolation that need to be studied, it is
            food and diet patterns in general. This is because silent epidemics
            such as malnutrition, obesity, and other food-related lifestyle
            diseases becoming more and more common. Since the 1990s, the
            emphasis has been placed on scientific, evidence-based research.
            Therefore, a lot more large-scale nutrition studies, randomized
            clinical trials, cohort studies, etc. are seen. But the reality is,
            despite progress across all spheres in lives, diet and food patterns
            are still driven by primal urges and needs. Every generation comes
            with its own set of health hazards. While human ancestors struggled
            to live longer, today, people are living longer but are crippled by
            lifestyle disorders. What does this mean? It means that the ‘one
            size fits all approach does not work when it comes to nutrition. It
            needs to be tweaked to the needs of the present situation and should
            be made sustainable. And of course, it should keep the diseases at
            bay.
